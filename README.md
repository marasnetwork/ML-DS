# ML-DS  
🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my personal projects as I learn and explore the fields of machine learning and data science using Python.

It reflects a hands-on journey — from fundamental concepts to more advanced techniques — through small experiments, notebooks, and end-to-end projects. I use this space to deepen my understanding, test new ideas, and document what I learn.

## 🔍 Focus areas

- Supervised & unsupervised learning  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Model training, evaluation, and tuning  
- Exploratory data analysis & data visualization  
- Practical machine learning workflows  

## 📁 Project structure

Each project typically contains:
- 📓 A Jupyter notebook or Python script
- 📊 Sample datasets (or links to them)
- 📝 Notes or brief explanations of the key learnings
- ✅ Results or evaluation metrics

## 📚 Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `01-linear-regression` | Basic implementation of linear regression from scratch and with scikit-learn | ✅ Completed |
| `02-logistic-regression` | Classification on a simple dataset using logistic regression | 🔧 In progress |
| `03-clustering-basics` | K-means and hierarchical clustering applied to synthetic and real-world data | 🚧 Planned |
| More coming soon... |

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
